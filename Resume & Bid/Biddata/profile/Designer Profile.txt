Fourth-year student. I study at the National Aviation University, as a system programmer and will be graduated in September 2022.

Since 2018, I have been studying and parallel working as a graphic designer. Begin with a temporary position in the Eurotherm holding. In more than 4 years of work, I have changed 2 design agencies and 3 marketing companies.

Begin with the development of printing and gradually moved into graphic design, developing my skills. Then I began to create logos, identity, and branding at the design agency Whales of Design. During quarantine, I left to work in the marketing department of BCA, where I was engaged in the creation of advertising creatives. Subsequently, I changed about two companies that also worked on the development of creatives for advertising.

In 2021, I joined the media-buying team, where, after three months of work as a support, I learned how to work with the Keitaro tracker and launch advertising campaigns on Facebook ads and TikTok ads. I was also involved in the development of creatives and the creation of various sales landings.

After four months of work as a media buyer, moved to the position of UX designer at Betasprint.

On February 24, my life changed dramatically. Now it is dangerous to return to my hometown and I decided to return to freelancing.
