Hi there. After reading your job description, then I am noticed that you need who has experience in not only ReactJS front-end and also ReactNative for mobile app. I am very familiar with GoogleMap Api too. 

First I have 4+ years of experience in React, Redux-Saga | Thunk, React Hooks, Styled component, and React Material UI. 

This is my latest work with React.

And then I have ReactNative(Typescript) experience in mobile app development. 

Back-end is always Node/Express or Python/Django. Laravel can be able for back-end. 

I use win10 and macOS in VMware. 

These are my latest mobile work.
