- Describe similar project
Your idea is very unique.
It is very similar to a project I designed and completed before. Even then, since it was a website related to human health, I set the color and finished it with a clean and hopeful feeling.
However, the purpose of this is not to advertise health-related products, but as a useful product for actual users to use. From design to artificial intelligence (deep neural network), I think it is a concept that can even update the version. This project, which seems simple yet broadly conceived, shows confidence that it will succeed.
