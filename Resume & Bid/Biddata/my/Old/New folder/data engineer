Hi
Good day
I've read your requirements very carefully.
I am a data engineer with 7 years of experience.
I was awarded a Master of Computer Science.
I built hybrid big data storage system based on Hadoop and HBase. I have a rich experience with Hive, Pig, etc.
Well versed with Python, JavaScript, R programming, SQL, NoSQL etc.
In particular, I am very brilliant at Python. Using python modules, I implemented deep learning technologies such as speech, face, handprint recognition. Ever experienced with NumPy, Tensorflow, Keras, Pandas, etc.
Good understanding of deep learning and artificial neural networks such as Hopefield, Feedforward, RNN, MNN, etc.
Experienced with almost all databases-SQL databases and NoSQL databases including HBase, Cassandra, MongoDB, etc.
While I was working in a Normia Consulting Company, I introduced a hybrid big file storage system using Hadoop and HBase. I added my idea to the Map/Reduce algorithm and implemented this system. Also experienced with query language Hive.
Now I'm really looking forward to discussing your project which is attracting me.
May I know more details to understand more? I wanna suggest some bright ideas for your company.
Hope to hear from you soon.
Thank you for your time.
Best regards
