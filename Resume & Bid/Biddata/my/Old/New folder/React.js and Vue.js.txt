Hi, sir
Most of the front-end pages actually contain many files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and maybe more than that but with React you can combine all of that work in one file and making the website load much speedy.
Also, instead of rendering the whole page when you click on some component you actually render that component only so that makes it more powerful in terms of visual and losing speed.






hi, sir

I am interested in your job posting.

But I have some questions because of title is so simple.
1. What kind of reciept system do you want?   
    Just like  https://invoicehome.com/ ?
2. What kind of receipts are be used in your website?

When making a website like this, can use several web languages such as react.js, vue.js.
Anyway I want to know about your work detail.
if you send me mockup/prototype of work, we could discuss about it deeply.

thanks
