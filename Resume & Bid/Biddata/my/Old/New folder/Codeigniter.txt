Hi, Sir.

What I want to say, I am a CI(codeigniter)expert with 7+ years long.
At first I want to know the simple issues with your CI project.

The advantage of CI framework is so easy to debug because of configuration is so succinct.
If these are not so serious, I can prove my skills on time.

I think your job needs to make a detail discussion.
if you send me your exact requirements, thank you.
