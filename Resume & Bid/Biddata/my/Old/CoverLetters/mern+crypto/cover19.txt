Greetings ✌️,
I can help you with your e-commerce web development project at a high level! I'm Alex, lead developer at BN Digital (https://bndigital.co), where we’ve been developing similar web apps for the last 12 years. Over our vast experience in design and technology (including SaaS for the Big4 audit firm and the healthcare vertical) will be at your service to create a premium digital experience for your users.

In addition, please take a look at some of our developed web apps:
https://nymcard.com/ – another good example of our capabilities (illustrations, animations & front-end)
https://getclair.com/ – Clair is a platform to pay employees the moment they clock out of work while giving them exceptional banking services. I was involved in the front-end development of the app and the internal administrative tool, heavily integrating it with the back-end team.
https://sortly.com/ – Sortly is an inventory management SaaS solution that enables businesses and teams to easily track what they have, where it is, and who has it. I refined an existing platform, built a comprehensive design system, implemented an updated UX approach through all platforms.
https://yesplz.ai/ – Yesplz is a silicon valley startup that provides an e-commerce recommendation engine for fashion retail. I helped to design, build, and deploy the minimum viable product, as well as most of the marketing materials and the tailor-made website.

P.S. We are not a classic agency — there are no account managers or other transactional costs associated with overhead — more like a cozy and creative space for a supportive environment.

Let's set up a call and discuss the details, I will answer all your questions. At your convenience?
