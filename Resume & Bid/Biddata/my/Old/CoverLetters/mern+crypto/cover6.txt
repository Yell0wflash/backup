Cover letter
Hey there,

I might be the best fit for you as per the requirements as I'm a flawless MERN & MEAN stack Developer with more than 7+ years of practical working experience. Also, I have done something similar before for GenShards (https://www.genshards.com/).

Here is the full case study:

GenShards is a Marketplace for preIDO tokens for NFTs where companies can mint and publish their NFT. I have used Web3 for the development using React+ Node for GenShards. Genshards also have staking pools where users can stake GS tokens and get GS rewards when the pool ends. I was working with a smart contract developer over this project where he was handling the solidity development and I helped in development using React + Node along with crypto wallet linking.

Also, like Opensea, Genshards also currently working on a marketplace for their unsold NFTs.

**Questions:**

Do you have a Blockchain Developer or team at the moment for this project?
How the processes will be managed? Are we going to use any tool like Jira?

Happy to connect with you and discuss this in brief for a better view. Accordingly, I can better answer your queries as well.

Let's discuss complete details in the inbox!

Kind regards,
Ajay
