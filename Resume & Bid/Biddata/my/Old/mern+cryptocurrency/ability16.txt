Cheers, all!
I'm a Full-Stack JavaScript developer digging my gold in React and Node.js for over 6 years.
I have successfully worked in all phases of software development, where deep understanding and professional expertise of advanced React and Node.js developers are needed.
Being equipped with rich skills in Full Stack MERN development, I'm 100% qualified for developing big and sophisticated Web and Mobile projects from scratch, producing perfectly documented and easily maintained source code, while paying attention to enabling peak performance at peak loads.
In addition to my React and Node.js proficiency, I have in-depth expertise in:
Front End Frameworks and Technologies:
React-Material-UI, React-Bootstrap, React Desktop, Semantic-UI-React, Redux, Bootstrap, HTML5/CSS3, SASS, LESS

Back End Toolkits:
Node.js, Nest.js, Express.js, Firebase

Databases:
MongoDB, Redis, ElasticSearch, MySQL, MSSQL, Postgres, DynamoDB

Version Control Systems:
Git

Test tools:
Jest, Enzyme, Jasmine, Mocha

Deployment:
Docker, Ansible, AWS EC2, ECS, Heroku

With all this being said, I'm ready to help you with developing software projects of any level of complexity as I am sure my professional background and skills will bring variety and performance to it.
I can run my mouth about my professional and personal advantages for quite a while, but why won't you just call me and ask me about those in person? That will certainly work better for both of us
