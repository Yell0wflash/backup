"Initially, this team was great and had a great team of developers. Then some of them moved on, and the team recommended a new iOS developer that introduced a lot of bugs in our app, and made our App Store reviews go down. After that they weren't able to find us a new developer, and we had to switch to a different team. I think this is a good organization, but they don't have a large group who can help if there are problems, and we got a bad developer when the team turned over."

"I could not be happier with Yuri and his team of Blazing Bears. The work was of extremely high quality, and they cared deeply about the product, making sure everything was in line and on time for our releases. There were no communication issues and everyone was highly responsive. I would work with them again in a heartbeat, it's rare to find such talent."
