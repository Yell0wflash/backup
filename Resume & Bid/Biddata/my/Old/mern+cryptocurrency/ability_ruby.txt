Ruby on Rails Development and Service (Ruby on Rails, VueJS, ReactJS)
$47.00/hr
Hello, Upworkers!

I have 8 years of web development experience. Now, I am a team member of an efficient Ukrainian software agency that provides development services in Ruby on Rails, Vue.js & React.

I have several key values in work:

- Communication
- Quality of code
- Discipline

Technology I use:

React, Vue.js, JavaScript (ES5, ES6), JQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Jasmine, Ruby, Ruby On Rails, Sinatra, Padrino, Sidekiq, Postgesql, MySQL, Redis, Linux, Git

Providing services:

- Web App development
- UX/UI Design
- Team Augmentation

Despite the fact that I mainly keep our focus on the chosen technical tools, I still gained proven expertise in the areas of traveling, avia, healthcare, coaching platforms, online education, and martech.

My experience is based on a variety of successful cases, mentoring of tech faculties for local universities, speaking at the local and international conferences and gaining official certifications.

I will glade to collaborate with you!

Freelancer's response
"It was a test task that can be found here https://github.com/gotoinc/store-api
The client did not like that parts of the code were copied. Some of the code was indeed copied but only from our own previous similar works, no code was taken from StackOverflow or similar resources.
We are grateful to Geoff for providing the opportunity to work on this task and are sorry that our vision did not correlate."
