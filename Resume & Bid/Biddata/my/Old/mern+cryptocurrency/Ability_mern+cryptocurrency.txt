Data/Info is a core element for every business. I can collect any data (text/image/video/etc.) for you. I can also make a bot that can fetch data from your target and upload it to your website or server on its own. I can make bots that can do things for you like a real human. Like browsing any website, log in and do certain things, etc. My bots will use AI to determine what to do based on certain circumstances. So it’s no less than human workers. It can be your very own personal virtual robot who can never betray/leave you. And it can work 24/7 for you.

Thing’s my bots can do:
- Use proxy
- Login/ Multilogin
- Multi-Threaded
- Scrap data
- Parse data
- Manipulate database
- Manipulate files
- Update information
- Upload documents
- Chat
- Log data in detail
- Move, scroll, click like a real human
- Faster than real human
And a lot more
