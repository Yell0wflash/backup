Hi there,

Thank you for your job post regarding Needed developers to make e-commerce projects using the MERN stack. Our team specializes in front and backend programming for bot development, data aggregation (scraping/manipulation), API integration, API development, website development, automation & scripting here at Core Devs.

We understand that you want to build an E-commerce project using MERN. What are the functionalities that you want on the website? Where do you want to host the website?

Our developer team has coding experience in multiple languages (not mutually exclusive to one) NodeJS, Python, Javascript, Web3.js, Express.js, Selenium, Puppeteer, and other RPA tools/libraries. And on the frontend side ReactJS, HTML, CSS.

Further to the above, we are a full team of 26 with 14 full-time developers (no outside contracting) allowing for us to provide full development and support consistently and with full support up to 20 hours a day. May we suggest a call (Zoom or Skype) to understand the requirements better and agree on the timeline with you? Thanks.

Kind regards,
Mahbub Shuvo,
Core Devs Team.
