"We are glad that UppLabs has helped us deliver some features for our project. Without them we would have to resort to deadlines being late. The outsource developer they provided was a smart guy that provided delivered work. We are happy to know that we don't need to redo the work (at least now). Eventually all features worked as expected and solution designs were good. However, communication with developer was difficult. Many times developer skipped standups, which was difficult for team to estimate delivery of tasks. Furthermore, communcation about deadlines were obsucre. Sprint completion was poor: many items have been hanging and only delivered accros multiple sprints (while estimations were for one sprint). Finally, we had a situation were an item by the end of the sprint was not delivered according to the specification, where criteria was clearly defined. We communicated about such issues to management 2 times. Atfer such talks, the situation improved a bit, but then everything reverted to the same old ways. I sincerly wish this company success and to be more attentive to the developers they give for outstaffing. However, we will unlikely to work with UppLabs anymore."
