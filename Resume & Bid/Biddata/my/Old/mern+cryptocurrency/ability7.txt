"Me and my team really enjoyed working with both Vatsal and Khushal, they are superb in their development works and are very sincere, and do what they promised to even though some time those task assigned to them are quite difficult, yet they managed to do the impossible.

I would love to work with them in the near future whenever possible.

Well, If you are thinking to use them or not, I would highly recommend to engage their services; as they are one of the few top notch developers I came across, they're also one of the few that came with the right attitude and mindset, these are the kind of developers anyone would dream to have in their dream.

I sincerely hope the best for your future endeavour, and we hope our path will cross again in the near future. Cheers!"
