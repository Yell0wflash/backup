Hello,

I represent Aurora TechLab - we are a Polish company. We have a Node.js + React team experienced in working in the crypto domain. E. g. Our mobile team recently delivered KickEX - https://kickex.com/ - one of the apps from KICK Ecosystem. It supports major coins - Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ethereum (ETH), USDT, and includes more than 50 live markets. In terms of tech stack the platform uses Node.js with Microservices architecture and Angular on the front-end. The applications has the following functionality:

- Few steps registration;
- Easy wallet creation;
- Stop Loss and Trailing Stop Order functionality;
- Gamified onboarding;
- Exchange rate;
- Live support;

Besides, do you have any documentation ready? Iâ€™d appreciate it if you share it with me.

If the above sounds feasible to you, I suggest scheduling a short online meeting to discuss the details. Could you please share free time slots for this/next week?

Yuri Rudenya,
Tech Lead
