Cover letter
Hey,

If you are seriously looking for a full-stack developer who can work on your project based on your needs then your search must stop here as our team has awesome developers who are well experienced in developing websites/portals using different technologies. So just share your requirements in more detail If there is any other too or share your more preferences with me so that I can start working immediately after understanding the work's scope.

Further, let me tell you that I am the co-founder of an agency and we've completed many web/mobile-based projects on a company level from scratch by satisfying our clients. Also, note that we’re able to allocate the developers to work directly with you on a monthly basis or on a fixed project basis with dedicated project management from our end as well If you need an individual developer only.

Though some of the good projects links are in the portfolio from where you can get a quick overview of the work, still let me throw some light on a few good projects below:
