"I have now worked with Vikram for 6 months with a big project for my electricity company, where I needed a website made in next js. The work overall was very satisfied. The project is done and made with perfection exactly as we wanted it.

He was always ready for work and complies all the agreements he make with you. If he has to work a few extra hours to finish the work, then that is what he is gonna do!

The communication was perfect through the project - fast and with good feedback.

Vikram has my reccomedation for sure - no doubt about that. Will for sure use him again for my future projects."
