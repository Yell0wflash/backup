Campbell Burgess 11:41 AM
sorry... the database is mysql (not server)

Cole Cancellieri 11:41 AM
great. That is a perfect match for my skills.

I know, LOL

Campbell Burgess 11:42 AM
Are you familiar with AWS implementations?

Cole Cancellieri 11:42 AM
Not really.

Campbell Burgess 11:42 AM
ok. How about docker?

Cole Cancellieri 11:42 AM
yes, I am familiar with docker container.

Campbell Burgess 11:43 AM
Do you work mostly on lunix or Windows?

*linux

Cole Cancellieri 11:43 AM
I write codes on Windows and deploy my project on Linux servers.

I am familiar with Linux.

Campbell Burgess 11:44 AM
OK.... on the project you sent me... let me ask some more questions.

Cole Cancellieri 11:45 AM
no problem.

Campbell Burgess 11:47 AM
When you establish a socket connection with the cient.... are you looping through all open connections (I opened 10 concurrent connections) or does node have 1 direct connection with each socket.... so, If there were 1,000 open connections, would you have to loop through all 1,000 open connections to know if a client entered data, or would a separate thread recognize that immediately?

Cole Cancellieri 11:49 AM
I don't need to loop through all 1000 open connections to know if a client entered data.

And in fact

Nodejs uses only 1 thread internally.

Campbell Burgess 11:49 AM
OK.... so we have a new project that I am also looking for help.

Cole Cancellieri 11:49 AM
It uses an asynchronous mechanism.

no problem

Campbell Burgess 11:50 AM
Have you worked with internal queueing systems.... like, say, rabbitmq?

Cole Cancellieri 11:51 AM
yes.

Campbell Burgess 11:52 AM
OK.... so how would you set something like this up......

We have 500 ATMs connecting to our datacenter.... we want those atms connecting to a given IP and port.

When we get the message, we want to reformat the message, and then enter that into a Rabbit Q.

Reading on the other side of the Rabbit Q is another node.js app... that reads the message, reformats the message, and then in a FIFO manner, submits that message to a network... like Mastercard or Visa..... however, those guys just accept messages, singularly, one after another.

The app that submits to the network also reads from the network, one at a time, and when it gets a response back, it will write that response out to Rabbit.

Now the original app that was first communicating with the ATM has to pick that message up from Rabbit, reformat based on the ATM type.... and then write a response back to the ATM.

.... the entire thought is that on the front end.... because there are 500 possible ATMs submitting at once... they all have to be served... but on the Mastercard/Visa side, they only want messages one at a time.

How would you construct that?

Cole Cancellieri 12:01 PM
ok

let me explain my idea.

Each ATM will have its own ID.

when it submits a message to the 1st Node.js server, the message must include the ID of ATM.

so through all processes, the message includes the ATM ID to distinguish the ATM.

Campbell Burgess 12:07 PM
Yes and no

Cole Cancellieri 12:07 PM
I think I need some time to design it more efficiently.

Campbell Burgess 12:08 PM
The initial message has the ATM id.... but as it works through the "system", we would substitute our own Id for the ATM id

But yes.... there is some type of ATM id going to the network and then being returned.

Cole Cancellieri 12:09 PM
yes

Campbell Burgess 12:10 PM
The trick is.... the front end is multi-threaded.... the network side is single-threaded.... and so how does the return message... on the single threaded side... get passed back to the multi-threaded interface.

that is on the database interface as well.

databases can certainly receive multiple requests.... but they perform better single-threaded

depending on the volume.

Cole Cancellieri 12:11 PM
The front end you are talking about is the 1st node.js app, right? Not a GUI with web pages. Then conceptions are a bit confusing.

that's ok anyway

Campbell Burgess 12:14 PM
yes... all of this is tcp socket communication

Cole Cancellieri 12:14 PM
yes

it has better performance than HTTP.

less overload

Campbell Burgess 12:15 PM
yes

how do you apply ssl to your node.js communications?

Cole Cancellieri 12:16 PM
for HTTP orTCP?

Campbell Burgess 12:17 PM
http

....so the client is hitting "https://somedomain.com:1345"

Cole Cancellieri 12:18 PM
ok

We can use 2 ways

the 1st method is to use reverse proxy such as NGINX.

the 2nd method is to add an SSL option such as an SSL certificate and private key when I create express-js sevrer.

btw, is it test or consulting?

Campbell Burgess 12:20 PM
ok.

test or consulting?

oh.... test

Cole Cancellieri 12:20 PM
ok

just joking. LOL

because it is a bit long test.

no problem

Campbell Burgess 12:21 PM
Sorry.... I always test.... we have standards that we want to apply... otherwise we go in very different directions.

Cole Cancellieri 12:21 PM
ok

Campbell Burgess 12:21 PM
It is fine to add this conversation to your hours

we will have a lot of conversation

Cole Cancellieri 12:22 PM
no problem

let's go on.

Campbell Burgess 12:22 PM
We are about at the end.

Cole Cancellieri 12:22 PM
sounds good.

Campbell Burgess 12:22 PM
Please send me your phone and email.

Cole Cancellieri 12:22 PM
will do

and you need my resume as well, right?

Campbell Burgess 12:23 PM
Our CIO (Yvette Hamm) will be reaching out to you and confirming your position. We will want to execute a separate contractor agreement.... but we can pay everything through upwork.

Yvette is not technical.... but she understand upwork.

Cole Cancellieri 12:23 PM
got it.

Can we do it after Xmas?

Campbell Burgess 12:24 PM
Yep.... enjoy your Christmas. Thank you.

Cole Cancellieri 12:24 PM
It is Xmas Eve.

thank you

so

I am considering if we can end the current contract with a good review.

Campbell Burgess 12:25 PM
Sure thing

Cole Cancellieri 12:25 PM
and how many hours will you pay for me?

Campbell Burgess 12:25 PM
You pick

Cole Cancellieri 12:26 PM
1 hour for the test project, 1 hour for this chatting, 2 hours total. ðŸ™‚

Campbell Burgess 12:26 PM
OK. enter that in

Cole Cancellieri 12:27 PM

Campbell Burgess 07:38 PM
Hey Cole.... just curious..... what does Upwork charge you on the platform when we make a payment?

Cole Cancellieri 07:39 PM
Well, 20%

Campbell Burgess 07:39 PM
...so on our payment of $40, you received $32?

Cole Cancellieri 07:39 PM

Thanks

Cole Cancellieri 07:40 PM
So, when can we start?

Campbell Burgess 07:40 PM
Tomorrow

Cole Cancellieri 07:41 PM
Okay, I will wait for your NDA

Are you going to send it via email?

Campbell Burgess 07:42 PM
Yvette will send the NDA

Cole Cancellieri 07:42 PM
okay

It is not a full time position?

Campbell Burgess 07:44 PM
it is... but we need to see some performance first. Hopefully you can get there in a week.

I am setting up some server access for you now.

Cole Cancellieri 07:45 PM
Okay, thank you

I will be back in 1 hour.

Cole Cancellieri 08:48 PM
Hi, I am back

Could you tell me about your project in detail?

Campbell Burgess 08:57 PM
Let's get on a phone call tomorrow morning for that. What is a good time?

Cole Cancellieri 09:10 PM
I'd prefer to chat. to note the details of the requirement.

Tue, Dec 27
Cole Cancellieri 07:28 AM
Good morning.
Could you please send me the requirements? I wanna have a document about it.

Cole Cancellieri 09:54 AM
Hi, Are you there?

Campbell Burgess 09:54 AM
Yes I am

Cole Cancellieri 09:55 AM
Could you send me the requirements/

Campbell Burgess 09:56 AM
They are not well documented. I'll see what I can pull together.

Cole Cancellieri 09:56 AM
no problem

take your time

Wed, Dec 28
Cole Cancellieri 06:40 PM
Hello, Are the documents ready?

Campbell Burgess 07:47 PM
No .. I will get to it .. since you asked... But documentation is one of my weaked points... So we will have to wait til I get to it

I also do not function very well... Limiting myself to texting... So to call it out, you seem to be focused on a structure that I do not function well in... That is documentation and texting as a form of communication.

Campbell Burgess 09:52 PM
Cole... have you worked with Docker?

Cole Cancellieri 09:53 PM
Sure

I have some experience with Docker

If the document is not ready yet, Could you explain here via chat?

Campbell Burgess 09:57 PM
Sure.

The 1st project.... we have a student website ....1098tforms.com

1098-T Forms
Home
HEY, COLLEGE STUDENTS! ENROLL AND DOWNLOAD YOUR 1098-T IRS FORM. > > TO STUDENT ENROLLMENT PAGE For help enrolling and downloading your 1098-T form, click the link below for detailed instructions. >> TO INSTRUCTIONS
On that website home page, you click to a portal..... "> > TO STUDENT ENROLLMENT PAGE "4

That goes to portal.1098tforms.com

That site is a docker site.

It is actually https://portal.1098tforms.com/student-enrollment

1098tforms.com - Student Enrollment
The first thing I need you to do is to get inside that docker site and make some changes

....and tell me what the connections are to the database

I am thinking that you should be able to run a test docker site on a stand-alone linux server.... but I am very new to docker

...remembering, If you do not know how to do something.. I need to know it

Cole Cancellieri 10:04 PM
okay, Can you share the docker image by google drive?

Campbell Burgess 10:05 PM
Let me set you up on my secure drive... hang on.

Give me your email again, please

Cole Cancellieri 10:05 PM
wanderingpaladin

it is my gmail account

wanderingpaladin@gmail.com

Campbell Burgess 10:09 PM
OK... accept that invite... and I will post the docker

Cole Cancellieri 10:10 PM
sorry, wanderingpaladin116@gmail.com

my mistake

Campbell Burgess 10:10 PM
Crap... Ok. Hold on

Cole Cancellieri 10:10 PM
ðŸ˜…

Campbell Burgess 10:18 PM
OK... you should have your invite

...and the docker zip is there

Cole Cancellieri 10:20 PM
got it

downloaded. What changes should I make?

Campbell Burgess 10:23 PM
Well.... can you launch it on your machine to see if it will respond to the "student-enrollment" with the same page?

If so, I need you to tell me what it is doing when the student enters his first name, last name and ssn

...and why it is so freaking slow

...it may be slow because of the hosting server on my side

Cole Cancellieri 10:25 PM
got it

let me check

Cole Cancellieri 10:35 PM
what is your node version?

Campbell Burgess 10:36 PM
no clue on that.... I think the date on that zip is 2020

Shouldn't that be inside the docker?

Cole Cancellieri 10:39 PM
sure, it is the source code inside the docker image

Campbell Burgess 10:39 PM
OK... So I need the docker image. hmmmm

Hang on

Cole Cancellieri 10:39 PM
okay

Campbell Burgess 10:40 PM
2.17.3

is that a version?

Cole Cancellieri 10:43 PM
I don't think so.

Campbell Burgess 10:43 PM
...that may be the Amazon Linux version

Cole Cancellieri 10:43 PM
ok

anyway share docker image

Campbell Burgess 10:44 PM
That is what I am trying to find. hang on

I am phoning support

Cole Cancellieri 10:46 PM
ok, take your time

Cole Cancellieri 11:45 PM
I installed the project on the local machine. I will check it and let you know the result soon.
Good night.

Campbell Burgess 11:45 PM
Thanks. Good night
