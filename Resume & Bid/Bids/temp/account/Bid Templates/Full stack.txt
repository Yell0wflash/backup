got this website http://128.199.246.104/

need to improve keep it simple and nice and compact for smartphone portrait mode / landscape / tablet / pc

need to work on win/osx/linux ie/ff/chrome/safari

make sure radio player still work and does not hang after a while

use html5 / laravel

will become a longer term project with map / camera / mqtt sync





Can we allow users to sort the marketplace by Vintage, Volume, Price, and Appellation fields? --> SORTING IN WOOCOMMERCE IS BASED ON ATTRIBUTES AND PRICE. AS APPELLATION PRE-DEFINED INPUTS, I MAKE IT ATTRIBUTE AND WOOCOMMERCE GRANT APPELLATION PERMISSION TO B SORTED. BUT VINTAGE AND VOLUME HAS NO PRE-DEFINED INPUTS. ITS TOTALLY DEPENDS ON USER. IT CANT B AN ATTRIBUTE. WOOCOMMERCE DOESNT GIVE THEM PERMISSION.


Can we make sure admins have vendor capabilities? --> BECAUSE WC VENDOR DONT WANT ADMIN TO B VENDOR

Let�s show each product�s available quantity here. If the product is a Bulk product then the availability/stock should be in Litres (L). If the product type is Shiners, then the stock should be in Bottles (BTL) --> ITS ALREADY FIXED


Can we add the Request Free Sample button to this page? --> ITS ALREADY DONE

Let�s make sure users can create offers or indicate �Not Interested?for each item separately within an order. Right now, it seems to default to the first product in the order --> I KNEW THIS TYPES OF DIFFICULTIES WOULD COME THATS WHY I MADE THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM. I TAKE SOME STEPS BECAUSE I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES.

Any way we can skip the cart page after the buyer accepts an offer and go straight to checkout for just that offer? I would like for buyers to be paying for each offer at a time and avoid mixing these with the sample cart or with other offers. --> I INFORMED U THAT THERE IS NOTHING CALLED "SAMPLE CART". THERE IS ONLY ONE CART AND EVERY TRANSACTION GOES THROUGH CART. YES WITH UR SUGGESTED PLUGIN WE CAN SKIP CART FOR SURE BUT THIS WILL B APPLIED FOR EVERY ORDER. NOT JUST FOR FINAL ORDERS.

got this website http://128.199.246.104/

need to improve keep it simple and nice and compact for smartphone portrait mode / landscape / tablet / pc

need to work on win/osx/linux ie/ff/chrome/safari

make sure radio player still work and does not hang after a while

use html5 / laravel

will become a longer term project with map / camera / mqtt sync





Can we allow users to sort the marketplace by Vintage, Volume, Price, and Appellation fields? --> SORTING IN WOOCOMMERCE IS BASED ON ATTRIBUTES AND PRICE. AS APPELLATION PRE-DEFINED INPUTS, I MAKE IT ATTRIBUTE AND WOOCOMMERCE GRANT APPELLATION PERMISSION TO B SORTED. BUT VINTAGE AND VOLUME HAS NO PRE-DEFINED INPUTS. ITS TOTALLY DEPENDS ON USER. IT CANT B AN ATTRIBUTE. WOOCOMMERCE DOESNT GIVE THEM PERMISSION.


Can we make sure admins have vendor capabilities? --> BECAUSE WC VENDOR DONT WANT ADMIN TO B VENDOR

Let�s show each product�s available quantity here. If the product is a Bulk product then the availability/stock should be in Litres (L). If the product type is Shiners, then the stock should be in Bottles (BTL) --> ITS ALREADY FIXED


Can we add the Request Free Sample button to this page? --> ITS ALREADY DONE

Let�s make sure users can create offers or indicate �Not Interested?for each item separately within an order. Right now, it seems to default to the first product in the order --> I KNEW THIS TYPES OF DIFFICULTIES WOULD COME THATS WHY I MADE THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM. I TAKE SOME STEPS BECAUSE I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES.

Any way we can skip the cart page after the buyer accepts an offer and go straight to checkout for just that offer? I would like for buyers to be paying for each offer at a time and avoid mixing these with the sample cart or with other offers. --> I INFORMED U THAT THERE IS NOTHING CALLED "SAMPLE CART". THERE IS ONLY ONE CART AND EVERY TRANSACTION GOES THROUGH CART. YES WITH UR SUGGESTED PLUGIN WE CAN SKIP CART FOR SURE BUT THIS WILL B APPLIED FOR EVERY ORDER. NOT JUST FOR FINAL ORDERS.
