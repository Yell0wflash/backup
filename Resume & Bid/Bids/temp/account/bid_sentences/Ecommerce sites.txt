Hi,

I am a very talented software programmer with 13+ years of development experience (5+ years professional work experience). I am a results-oriented professional and possess experience using cutting-edge development tools and technology stacks and have high aptitude for designing and implementing new software.

I possess an outstanding ability to pay attention to detail, have professional communication skills, and am productive in both team-based and self-managed projects. I am very dedicated to maintaining up-to-date industry knowledge and IT skills.

I have responsive front-end development experience using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS 2, Bootstrap 4, and AJAX. I also have experience requesting and sending data to web servers using JSON and XML.

For back-end server-side development, I have developed in PHP (MySQLi OOP with MariaDB), Java/J2EE, C, C++, and .NET(C#). I used XAMPP's Apache web server therefore have experience with MariaDB (MySQL fork) and SQL. I have also used Node.js with a windows shell and the Express.js module using Node.js. Lastly, I have experience with React.js and Redux.js. I developed in Visual Studio Community 2017 for C and C++.
