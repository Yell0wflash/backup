Dear client,

I have lots of experience in booking platform development and ensure the delivery of a qualified product within timeline.

I've worked under Saas Innovative Hotel Booking software, where I applied encryption for hotel booking system to secure the data of users and the hotels.

Please check some of my past projects :

http://www.flynas.com (Node.js)
http://au.gradconnection.com (Node.js + Django for backend, React for frontend)
https://meduza.io (React frontend)

I have deep knowledge in OOP programming, procedural programming and various software design patterns.
I am a communicative and detail-oriented developer and a perfect team player!
I also have much experience working in an agile environment as well.

If you need a skillful programmer for a long-term project, you'd love to work with me.

Ready for the interview.

Best regards,
