Greetings,

I've read your job posting and feel that I am the perfect match for this as I have all the skills required.

- I use ES6/ES7 with babel to write clean, easy-to-follow code.
- Github/bitbucket for source code management.
- Mocha/chai as a unit testing framework and codeship for auto testing & deployments.
- All my codes will be eslint free with many inline comments.

I am very well-versed in agile approach in project development and really love to add my creativity to the overall project implementation.

Also, having worked as a database administrator and project manager for several projects back at the agency, I am able to design and manage startup projects from ground-up with high attention to scalability and future maintenance.

I usually try to follow the best practices in code structure and SDLC, and especially keep with the SOLID DRY KISS principle.

Please check the following websites as a reference to my recent work :

https://angel.oroboo.com (AngularJS, Bootstrap, SASS, Laravel, WebRTC)

https://parlourgigs.com (MEAN Stack)
https://v2-beta.crooklynclan.net/# (MEAN Stack - Audio management with ffmpeg)
http://bityo.io (developed a crypto payment system using Bitgo)

And having dealt with lots of algorithmic research before working on this web development field, I can handle challenging problems professionally with quality.

Ready to discuss more about the project during the interview.
Best regards,
