As a recent & relevant experience, I designed and implemented the ERC20 token based ecosystem.
I will tell more details about my previous ecosystem when tech interview.
Main business model was constructed between talents and fans, important feature was not to sale token while ICO, instead of it, while running the ecosystem token sale is processed.
In order to implement his idea to the real business, first of all I designed overall ecosystem including Database ERDiagram, API definition diagram, UI mockup, etc. 
Also I developed the corresponding all software alone, that was included following tech stacks:
1) Bitcoin related: Ethereum token wallet using web3.js, Solidity programming to audit token.
2) backend REST API: node.js framework - express.js
3) database: Postg
 reSQL, MongoDB
4) Admin panel: React library - React.js
5) Mobile wallet app: React framework - React Native
6) Automated Test for backend - Mocha, for React - Jest and Enzyme
