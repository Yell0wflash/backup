Greetings,

I have read the job description and think I have all the expertise required for the job.

I have DevOps experience back at my agency, and I took charge of various project roles - including experience of leading 6~7 developers and designers on iOS/Unity3D projects.

I also have profound knowledge of development to its core. (starting from ground level C/C++ to most Web technologies as well as Android/iOS native skillsets)

Especially, I'm skilled in MEAN, MERN and LAMP stacks.

I usually use Bitbucket for the source code & deployment management.

Ready to discuss further and get started immediately.
Best regards,
