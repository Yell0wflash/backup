Hi,

Let me get straight to the point here as you didn't want any generic templates :

I am an expert frontend developer and have built various full-stack websites (mainly on MEAN stack) with complex backend logic & UI elements.

I am very proficient in NodeJS and have integrated lots of APIs including Twilio, FB, etc and also have developed several custom APIs myself.

Please check the following projects as a reference to my past work :
http://www.bookingbash.com (AngularJS - Movie Booking System)

With these skills and experience, I'm sure I can be a valuable asset to your team by providing quality work and suggesting creative ideas.

I can devote 30~35 hours a week and work on EST/PST working hours.

Ready for the interview.

Best regards,
