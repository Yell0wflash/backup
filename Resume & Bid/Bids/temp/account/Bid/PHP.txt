Hi,
I just read your job posting and I think I can be a ideal candidate to your project because I am good at Yii2 framework and I can work on your timezone.
As a professional web developer, I started web development using PHP and have done many projects using Yii2.
I am good at Yii2 framework components and several widgets so that can build backend using that while I can tackle any kind of issues on developing backend using this.
As a javascript expert, I am good at React and love to use Redux workflow so I can build independent and user-friendly front end using that.
Also have got some experiencese with Elastic Search while I love to deploy Projects on AWS EC2, Beanstalk etc.
So I can meet your requirements perfectly and can provide good result to you.
I am looking forward to have more discussion with you and can start working right now.
Thanks
