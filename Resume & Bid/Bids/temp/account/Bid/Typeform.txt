Hello how are you?
I had developed many websites and also I have experience in UX design by Typeform
I think about typeforme as following.
Typeform creates beautiful forms that look great and provide a wonderful UX.
Typeform works well for stand-alone forms. 
Typeform makes complex forms look very simple by showing users only what's relevant to them right now.
Thanks.
