Greetings,

I have read your job description and found that I can be the perfect match with all the required skills.
My skillsets are as following:
- Angular(1.x: 5+ yrs, 2: 2years,) 
I have used Angular framework to create several large project from ground up and update some in progress.
Then I got very interested in Angular2 since it makes heavy use of Typescript as a typing. Actually I think it enables Angular to overcome its non-typing issue, one of the critical drawbacks of JavaScript itself.
I am very familiar with Angular ui bootstrap, Angular material and some material & bootstrap dashboard themes(Metronics, Fuze).
- React(2+ yrs)
I've been much experienced in React, Redux and Flux to boot.
Actually I found React makes the project going successfully and running with great performance. I've worked on React bootstrap themes(Rubix, BeyondAdmin).
- Related Techs
Some of them are Task runners(grunt, webpack, gulp), JS preprocessor(Coffeescript), JS typing(Typescript), devOps(Babel), CSS preprocessor(Sass, Less, Bourbon), JavaScript utility libraries(lodash, underscore, linqjs) and Module loaders(ES6, ES7, commonjs, AMD, requirejs)
- Testing Scripts
I have best practise in JavaScript testing(Phantomjs, Casperjs) and unit test framework(Jasmine, Mocha, Karma).

With my skills and experiences, I can develop your project perfectly on time.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Best Regards,
