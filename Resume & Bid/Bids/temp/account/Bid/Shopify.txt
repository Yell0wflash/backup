Hi,

I am an expert Shopify developer with more than 4 years of experience on it.


I have been working on this web development for more than 8 years and can handle most aspects of the frontend and backend stuff.


I have built several Shopify apps and customized various themes and thus can implement the fixes and improvements very fast with quality.

Ready to discuss further on the role.

Best,







Hi,

I have more than 10 years of web development experience and I have worked on numerous ecommerce projects based on various frameworks and CMSes.



I have managed several Shopify projects alone starting from customization of existing stores to building the whole stores up from design.



Please check the following Shopify projects I worked on :

Ready to discuss further.

This is a quite familiar concept which is adopted by many review sites online.

If you're managing the whole process yourself atm, then I need to know how you're planning to change the business flow.


Do you already have an inventory of items? 
Are you going to keep with your current operational structure, but just want to bring in the affiliate model to recommend other stores also?





Well, I have worked on many affiliate and offerwall implementations.

But not much experience with this type of business transformation.


I am sure I will be able to suggest a feasible solution on the development side with my years of experience working on the ecommerce field though.
