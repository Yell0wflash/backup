Greetings,

I've read your job posting and feel that I am the perfect match for this as I have all the skills required.

I've built and worked on various websites based on AngularJS before moving on to the AngularJS, Angular 2 and 5 projects. (I really enjoyed the new versions since introducing TypeScript, but still got a firm grasp of the old version)
I have expertise in ES6 based applications and always implement a thorough testing to ensure error-free live solution.
Also, having worked at an agency for years, I am quite familiar and feel comfortable to work in an agile development environment.

Please check the following websites as a reference to my recent work :

I usually try to follow the best practices in code structure and SDLC, and especially keep with the SOLID DRY KISS principle.
And having dealt with lots of algorithmic research before working on this web development field, I can handle challenging problems professionally with quality.

Ready to discuss more about the project during the interview.
Best regards,
