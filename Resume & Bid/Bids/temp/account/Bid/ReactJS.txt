Greetings,

I am a professional developer with Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and more than 8 years of Web development experience.

I really feel that I am the perfect fit for this project as I have enough skills and experience required for this job - I'm quite addicted to modern Javascript stacks like Node, React and Angular with 1.5 years of experience with React alone.

Following are my previous work on ReactJS :

https://seatgeek.com/
https://www.chefsplate.com/
https://parlourgigs.com/
http://www.moodwonder.com

I started my programming career after graduating university mainly with C/C++ and Java - thus I have dealt very much with the algorithms and SDLC workflow.
Then I turned to this web development field following the rapid growth of internet marketplace and the growing need for the web services & applications.

I'm not a mere coder who learnt coding languages online or on a short course and dived into this IT field - I'm a professional who has gone through systematic education and have deep knowledge about the structure of the hardware & software integration.
These experiences affect much on one's problem solving methodologies and skills.

Thanks for your read, ready to discuss more about the project during the interview.
Best regards,

Greetings,

I've read your job posting and feel that I am the perfect match for this as I have all the skills required.

I've built and worked on various websites based on AngularJS before moving on to the AngularJS, Angular 2 and 5 projects. (I really enjoyed the new versions since introducing TypeScript, but still got a firm grasp of the old version)
I have expertise in ES6 based applications and always implement thorough testing to ensure an error-free live solution.
Also, having worked at an agency for years, I am quite familiar and feel comfortable to work in an agile development environment.

Please check the following websites as a reference to my recent work :

https://artistsunlimited.com (MEAN Stack - uses SoundCloud API)
http://www.bookingbash.com (AngularJS - Movie Booking System)
http://makolahub.com (AngularJS, Bootstrap, Symfony2)
https://angel.oroboo.com (AngularJS, Bootstrap, SASS, Laravel, WebRTC)

I usually try to follow the best practices in code structure and SDLC, and especially keep with the SOLID DRY KISS principle.
And having dealt with lots of algorithmic research before working on this web development field, I can handle challenging problems professionally with quality.

Ready to discuss more the project during the interview.
Best regards
