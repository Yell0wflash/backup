First
You have written such as
const { data } = await axios.put('/api/setup_intent', {
	id: user._id,
	paymentIntentId,
});
In my opinion, 
const { data } = await axios.put('/api/setup_intent', {
	id: user._id,
	paymentIntentId: user._paymentIntentId,
});
??

Second
You have written in method of confirmCardPayment such as
const payload = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(data.clientSecret, {
	payment_method: paymentId
})
In my opinion,
const payload = await stripe.confirmCardPayment(data.client_secret, {
	payment_method: paymentId
})
why? there is a reason.
Look another picture I give you.


  import init, {main} from "./client_w.js"
  import scala.async.Async.{async, await}
  async {
    printIn("index.html: await init");
    await init();
    printIn("index.html: done");
  }
