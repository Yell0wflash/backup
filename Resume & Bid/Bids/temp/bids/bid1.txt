Hi, In response to your posting on Upwork I am here to apply for the project.
 I have an excellent background as a Software Engineer along with my academic education in Computer Engineering and Technology. 
The experience and my academic education have provided me with some outstanding and technical skills. 
Furthermore, I have the excellence of creating upstanding designs of novelty. 
I firmly believe that these qualities make me different from the rest of the contestants I have recently developed a software with its three versions (Desktop, Web, Chrome). 
I would like to inform you that I am highly skilled with React JS, Electron, JAVA, Node JS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScrip as I have handsome experience with them. 
Still, I am always eager to learn anew and make my skill sharper whenever I get any chance. 
I have reviewed your requirements and I think building website for this platform will take approximately one month but I can share accurate timeline after discussing and understanding it further. 
For why I believe myself to be the best candidate and a great asset to your project. 
My profile, portfolio, and work history are also attached herewith for your kind consideration that will help you recognize my skill: https://www.behance.net/aliabbas21
 If you think I'm capable of your requirements and want to share more information regarding this project then kindly let me know. 
Thank you for taking the time to review the letter. 
Iâ€™ll look forward to hearing from you for further process.
 Ali Abbas

Happy Friday, :) 
I saw you are looking to build a website for your project I sent the application to this job post because Iâ€™ve been obsessed with crypto and blockchain for almost 5 years and I feel that a new NFT project can make a great positive impact in the crypto space I also know how confusing and overwhelming it is to deal all the complexities in such a project, and to find good talent that knows what they are talking about. 
Here are some examples of my work that I have developed in the past that accomplish similar outcomes to your own project: 
www.sloppybees.com 
	- NFT Website, minting logic, frontend connection and smart contract www.digitaltwinclub.com 
	- NFT Website, minting logic and frontend connection, and smart contract https://opensea.io/collection/the-cyclops-monkey-club 
	- Smart contract written https://opensea.io/collection/nft-the-companion 
	- Smart contract Written Besides being a crypto expert.
iâ€™ve also been a software developer for 10 years, having worked with clients around the world such as Burger King in the US and The Trainline in the UK, and Iâ€™m confident iâ€™m capable of providing you a premium service on the technical part, so that you can focus solely on growing your crypto business. 
Hereâ€™s what you can expect: 
	1. Fully Tested Smart Contracts, so that your dapp is bulletproof secure 
	2. Cutting Edge Web 3.0 Development, providing your users with fast and intuitive user experiences on hour Dapps 
	3. Timely Delivers 
	4. Constant and Clear Communication I always make a point to deliver the work in time and top quality is my number one priority, so choose to work only with a few clients at each time.
It is also very important to me to work with clients who have a long-term vision for their business and are passionate about it. 
If that sounds like you, I'll be more than happy to get to know more of you and figure out if we're a good fit I offer you an invitation for a free consultation call where :   I will give feedback on your current development/design practices & strategies. 
I will also share my own process for delivering safe and performant crypto projects.
You can choose the day and the time in the calendar link down below and i will call you in upwork ;) https://danielsilvacrypto.youcanbook.me/ The budget proposed is a placeholder. We need to investigate the scope of the project

Coding Secure NFT, DeFi & Blockchain Projects
$97.00/hr

Looking for code thatâ€™s written by an amateur and is full of security vulnerabilities? Ya, didnâ€™t think so. You want an expert you trust to handle the most critical component of your project: Your code. Blockchain code is immutable (it canâ€™t be changed). If you donâ€™t get this part right, it can sink your entire project. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here to help. Iâ€™ve been involved in blockchain development since 2017, coding for over 20 years, I was a ranking Captain and Physicist in the Air Force, CTO & CEO at a few technology companies, and Iâ€™m so passionate about this space that I constantly annoy friends and family because I never stop talking about it. Simply put, Iâ€™m an expert. So if youâ€™re looking for someone to guide you through this world, give you fast and reliable deliveries (with FULL transparency), and make sense of all of the technical jargon for you, Iâ€™m your guy. If youâ€™re serious about building a project that shapes the future (and make serious money in the process), shoot me a message and letâ€™s schedule a call.
