Greetings,

I'm an expert .NET developer with more than 5 years of experience with C# and .NET Core.
I also follow thorough TDD flow and have very good understanding of DB management with Entity Framework.
Having deployed and managed several web apps to Azure and private Windows servers, I can manage the deployment of .NET APIs and apps along with SQL server management with ease.

The good thing here is that I can work on both .NET and frontend solutions (React, Angular, Vue, etc) - although it's not ideal to have someone work on both stacks in one project, it's always very useful to know the other side of the role so that I can make my stuff more integrable and well documented.
I have a proactive attitude with sense of ownership and strong work ethics and having worked at various agencies in my career, acquired excellent organizational and time management skills.
