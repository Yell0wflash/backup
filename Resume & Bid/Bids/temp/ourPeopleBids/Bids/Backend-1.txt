Hi,

I am a backend developer proficient with Javascript and Python. I am proficient with most of the JS & Python frameworks out there and can utilize the best one suiting your needs.

I'm very experienced at integrating third party APIs via REST and SOAP (in the old days..). As long as a proper documentation is provided, I can implement any kind of API whatever the authentication method is and whatever structure they ask for & provide.

I also worked with various databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and some ArangoDB and can handle complex DB queries and optimizations with ease.

Ready to discuss further on the position.

Best,
