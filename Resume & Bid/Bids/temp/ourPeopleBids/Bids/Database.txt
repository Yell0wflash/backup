Hi,

Having worked on web development for more than 8 years with strong focus on backend, I have attained a thorough experience with database management.

I have dealt with most of the famous database solutions known including RDB (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL), NoSQL(Mongodb, ArangoDB) and GraphQL.

I always prioritize database structure design and optimization on any project development as it has a crucial impact on the overall development and performance of the product.

I also have strong knowledge with advanced techniques and querying such as transactions, triggers, complex subqueries & joins in SQL databases and aggregation, indexing, projections, etc in NoSQL databases.

With this professional experience, I can manage any complex database solutions professionally with an optimal performance guaranteed.

Let's discuss further.

Thanks,
