Hi,

I have been working for enterprise-level private projects for years and have very much skills and experience with all the required skillsets mentioned.

I started my web development career with PHP and could thus attain thorough knowledge about its syntax and various frameworks & libraries based on it.

Also, I mainly concentrated on JS stacks these days and have worked on several side projects other than the main project at agency.

I have profound knowledge about the SDLC workflow and put top priority on code quality.

I usually try to keep SOLID DRY KISS principle in my code writings.

Please check the following sites as a reference to my past work :

http://rnbass.com (Vue frontend with soundcloud & youtube API integration)
http://touringlegends.com (Laravel)
https://supacaz.com (Woocommerce)
https://supacazb2b.com (Prestashop)

*I'm willing to do a test task to show off my skills in the fields.*

Ready to discuss further.

Best,
