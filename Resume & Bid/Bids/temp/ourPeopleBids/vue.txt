Dear hiring manager
I am a professional software developer with hands on experience in website development.

For more than 15 years, I have contributed to several notable projects for US organizations and individual clients primarily focusing on MEAN Stack, PHP, Python, React/Redux and AWS.

Especially, I have exceptional skills in vue.js, vuetify, vuex, nuxt, Typescript, Webpack and ES6/7.
A very good show case of my vue.js development experience can be seen at https://www.miramir.com (vue.js, vuex, Webpack).

I am relatively fast at providing prototypes and MVPs thus you will experience the best value of time working with me.
Flexibility in working hours and quick communication traits can definitely be a plus for this specific project.
I also consider myself a great communicator and team player.

I would love to chat with you if you are interested.
Thank you
