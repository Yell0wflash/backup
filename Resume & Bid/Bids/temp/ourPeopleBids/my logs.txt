I have read your job description and it sounds very simple which require to change a few lines of code for removing features or changing colors
However, I’d like to see your website and list of tasks first to provide you better timeline and cost.
Will let you know

I will let you know how long it will take to finish the list of tasks what you indicated
Are you going to change the design only?
