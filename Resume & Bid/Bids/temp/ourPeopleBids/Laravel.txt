Greetings,

I'm a professional developer with Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and more than 8 years of Web development experience.

I started my programming career after graduating university mainly with C/C++ and Java - thus I have dealt very much with the algorithms and SDLC workflow.

I am very well-versed in agile approach in project development and really love to add my creativity to the overall project implementation.

Also, having worked as a database administrator and project manager for several projects back at the agency, I am able to design and manage startup projects from ground-up with high attention to scalability and future maintenance.
