Greetings,

I have read the job description and I think I have all the expertise required for the job.
I have been a full-stack web developer for 6+ years and have wide experience of web development.
Especially I have rich experience in MEAN stack.
And more specifically, I have project management experience back at my agency years ago, and I took charge of various project roles - including experience of leading 6~7 developers and designers on iOS/Unity3D projects.

The main web skill sets of mine are as follows:
-LAMP stack
-Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io, Hapi.js, Sails.js Expert 
-AngularJS, ReactJs and jQuery expert for front end 
-Mysql, Mongodb, Postgresql expert for database development 
-AWS, Heroku and Azure expert for hosting 
-Version control: Github, Bitbucket

I have project management skills along with profound knowledge of development to its core. (starting from ground level C/C++ to most Web technologies as well as Android/iOS native skillsets)
I also have passed Cambridge Business English Certificate (BEC Higher) exam, and thus can form a seamless conversation flow with CEO and with the developers to get the requirements clear to the small bits (which is a very important aspect in a CTO's role).
* Also a hard worker myself and I always do my best to fulfill my responsibilities *

Ready to get interviewed and get on to the project.
Best regards
