Hi,

My competitive advantage is an excellent track record on Upwork; I have delivered over $1M and all projects are 5-star rated, including significantly large and/or complex apps that I have helped to build.

Testimonials from my clients would tell you more about the quality and type of work I am experienced in and excel at. Please check my profile -- All completed projects have been 5-star rated, ranging from small projects of 1-2 months to larger implementations, involving several developers for multiple months.

Here are some selected projects that I would like to highlight:
1. Healthcare startup.
This is a very complex solution that is installed in a range of SafeWays in Phoenix, AZ.
Check out this breaking news story from their local NBC affiliate station: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4yoHnQXmik
It uses Web/Tablet apps, Machine learning, NLP, Augmented Reality, and multiple hardware integrations in the platform.
Stack: Python/Django and Angular, DB PostgreSQL, heavy use of AWS services

2. https://www.kandji.io/
This is a California startup which we developed, We engaged them at pre-seed and helped grow to 100M investments
Deployment for this b2b on AWS/Kubernetes.
Tech stack: Kubernetes, Python/Django, React.

3. Metamap.com
This is another Californian startup which raised a 70M Series B. We have over 35 developers working for them.
Tech stack: Python, React, Node.js.


My main strength is a proven ability to deliver, as I never take on projects which I cannot deliver on time and with great quality.

When would be a good time for us to have a call to discuss the unique details of your project?

For 17+ years I scale teams and teach developers, so they can cope with any complexity of the project now.

I am a Senior Software Developer with 8+ years of experience in building mobile and web apps and tech lead in a team of 90+ experienced developers and designers. We're also SaaS and Dashboard experts and I'm 100% positive that we can level up your project.

Our passion is to work with smaller companies and start-ups as we are well aware of the challenges you are facing. We are well versed in features that would make your product stand out from the competition and make it a top-notch one! 🙂 We've built a list of strong references and have established a long-term collaboration with a number of US and European start-ups and companies such as Ping, Corrily (just accepted by Y Combinator), Casting Frontier, Krome Studio, Skale, Remit Finder, FatSack, Beyond Pulse, WordReference, Adspert, PickPack.de, Movinga, Parquery AG, Hivemind AG, iTrust AG, Glemser Learning AG, Volag System AG, Artidis... 📌


ABOUT US

We are driven to write component-based code with strong implementation with Typescript to ensure as little as possible code is written twice. Typescript assures proper modeling data, structuring code, and in the end, clean JS implementation. We are always adapting to the new industry trends, and besides clean React code, we are using Next.JS for client-facing applications and websites.

Our goal is to create readable, intuitive, and organized code for each project no matter if we are working on MVP or enterprise projects. The team is focused to be always in step with the latest technologies and business practices following strict guidelines when creating each project. We like to use JavaScript on the frontend and on the backend, and one of our key strengths is extended knowledge in writing Node.js-based backend API services.

👉GoRide - Airbnb for boats - a complex boat rental platform with several moving parts. It consists of a custom web interface built in React. We're using mobx for the state management, Axios as HTTP client, and Node.js for the backend architecture. Besides that, there is an admin panel for boat owners and a separate customer-facing Android tablet app built-in Kotlin for on-boat use.
