Hello sir
I have just read your detail descriptions carefully. 

I am just a perfect javascript specialist with 7+ years.
In particular, I built the similar websites you want now.
I think the important thing on your website  is how to use map module.

But I have some questions.
1. Which kinds of maps do you want to use?  
      google.map? or baidu.map?
      local map? or global map?
2. Date and Time form?

It was just my simple offer to you.
If you answer me on my questions detaily, I'll say 'thanks' to you. 

Best Regards.
